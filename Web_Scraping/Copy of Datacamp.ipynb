In this non-technical course, you’ll be introduced to everything you were ever too afraid to ask about this fast-growing and exciting field, without needing to write a single line of code. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll learn about the different data scientist roles, foundational topics like A/B testing, time series analysis, and machine learning, and how data scientists extract knowledge and insights from real-world data. So don’t be put off by the buzzwords. Start learning, gain skills in this hugely in-demand field, and discover why data science is for everyone!'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iCFDnr9jtVfR","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
